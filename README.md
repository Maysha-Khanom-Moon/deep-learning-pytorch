# Deep Learning
<b>Machine Learning:</b> Turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers

- DL --> ML --> AL

Rule 1 of Google's Machine Learning Handbook:
> "If you can build a <b>simple rule-based</b> system that doesn't require machine learning, do that."

#### What deep learning is good for?
- Problems with long lists of rules - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/ deep learning may help.
- Continually changing environments - deep learning adapt (learn) to new scenarios.
- Discovering insights within large collection of data - can you imaging trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like?


#### What DL is not good for? (typically)
- When you need explain-ability - the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.
- When the traditional approach is a better option - if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.
- When errors are unacceptable - since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predictable.
- When you don't have much data - deep learning models usually require a fairly large amount of data to produce great results.
