# Deep Learning
<b>Machine Learning:</b> Turning things (data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers

- DL --> ML --> AL

Rule 1 of Google's Machine Learning Handbook:
> "If you can build a <b>simple rule-based</b> system that doesn't require machine learning, do that."

### What deep learning is good for?
- Problems with long lists of rules - when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/ deep learning may help.
- Continually changing environments - deep learning adapt (learn) to new scenarios.
- Discovering insights within large collection of data - can you imaging trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different kinds of food look like?
